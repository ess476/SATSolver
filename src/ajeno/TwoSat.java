/** An implementation of a 2-SAT solver, which takes as input a boolean formula
 * in 2-CNF normal form (a conjunction of disjunctions with two literals per 
 * clause).  Unlike 3-SAT, which is known to be NP-complete and which is
 * suspected to admit no polynomial-time solutions, 2-SAT has a linear-time
 * solution.  This is the implementation used here.
 *
 * The key insight that makes 2-SAT solvable in polynomial-time is the fact
 * that a clause of the form (A or B) is equivalent to (~A implies B) AND (B
 * implies ~A).  Given this, we can convert any clause with two literals in it
 * into two directed implications.  This general construction allows us to
 * convert any 2-SAT formula into a graph of implications between all the
 * literals in the formulae and their negations.  We can then follow those
 * implications to see if that graph implies a logical impossibility.  In
 * particular, if in the graph of implications we find that A implies ~A and
 * ~A implies A, then we know that the formula is unsatisfiable.  If, however,
 * no node and its complement imply each other, we can show that the formula is
 * satisfiable.  The proof is as follows.  Begin by partioning the implication
 * graph into strongly-connected components.  If a literal and its complement
 * each imply each other, then they will be in the same connected component and
 * we can detect this efficiently.  If not, then each literal and its
 * complement must be in different connected components.  We can then decompose
 * the graph into a DAG of SCCs, then label the components of the SCC with
 * boolean values such that no SCC labeled true has an ancestor labeled false.
 * This involves some fun induction on the structure of the graph to prove.
 * However, if all that we're interested in is whether the input formula is
 * satisfiable, then we can do so by constructing the implication graph, 
 * finding its strongly connected components, then checking whether any node
 * and its negation are in the same SCC.  We can construct the implication
 * graph in O(n) time (where n is the number of formulae), and the graph has
 * O(n) nodes and O(n) edges.  Finding SCCs takes O(n) time using either
 * Tarjan's or Kosaraju's algorithm, and confirming that each node is in its
 * own SCC takes O(n) for a total runtime of O(n).
 *
 * This implementation relies on the existence of a Kosaraju class, also from
 * the Archive of Interesting Code.  You can find it online at
 *
 *         http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=kosaraju
